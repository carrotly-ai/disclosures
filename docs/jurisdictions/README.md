# Jurisdiction coverage

`disclosures` exposes **seven intent-based tools** that dispatch on a `jurisdiction`
parameter (default `US`). The tool names never change between jurisdictions — only the
underlying data source does. Where a jurisdiction has no normalized equivalent to an
intent, the tool returns an explicit **unsupported-jurisdiction explanation** rather than
an empty or fabricated result.

This directory documents each jurisdiction in depth. For the quickstart, client
configuration, and library API, see the top-level [README](../../README.md).

## Coverage matrix

| `OwnershipChain` | 🌐 Global via GLEIF — jurisdiction-independent (resolved from LEI or legal name) |

✅ supported · — returns an honest unsupported-jurisdiction explanation · 🌐 global

`OwnershipChain` takes no `jurisdiction` parameter: it is GLEIF Level-2 relationship data
for any entity worldwide. It reports accounting-consolidation parents and children, which
are **not** market-disclosure ownership and **not** UBO tracing.

## Data sources and credentials

| Jurisdiction | Source | API key | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| US | SEC EDGAR + GLEIF | None (SEC needs a descriptive User-Agent) | [US.md](US.md) |
| GB | Companies House + FCA NSM + filings.xbrl.org | `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY` (NSM is inject-only) | [GB.md](GB.md) |
| EU | filings.xbrl.org (ESEF) + GLEIF | None | [EU.md](EU.md) |
| KR | DART / OpenDART | `OPENDART_API_KEY` | [KR.md](KR.md) |
| JP | EDINET | `EDINET_API_KEY` (search only; resolution is keyless) | [JP.md](JP.md) |
| CN | cninfo (SSE/SZSE/HKEX mirror) | None | [CN.md](CN.md) |
| IN | BSE India | None (host is anti-bot; inject a `fetchFn` if throttled) | [IN.md](IN.md) |
| TW | TWSE OpenAPI | None | [TW.md](TW.md) |
| BR | CVM open data | None | [BR.md](BR.md) |

## Honesty invariants (all jurisdictions)

- **Resolution misses** return "Could not find…" / "No … found" **without** `isError`.
- **Configuration, upstream, parse, and rate-limit failures** return readable text with
  `isError: true`, naming the variable or condition to fix — never a silent empty result.
- Every link is a real, resolvable source URL; the library never fabricates identifiers or
  documents.
- **Absence is not proof.** No Form D does not prove a company never raised privately; a
  missing PSC does not prove no controller exists; a missing ECCTA identity-verification
  field does not prove an officer is unverified.
